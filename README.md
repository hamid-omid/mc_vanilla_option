Vanilla Option Pricing 
========================

This is the source code written in **C++** for pricing a **Vanilla Option**
 [(European) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_style). We use a Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the price of call/put option using [**Black-Sholes model**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model). [**Box-Muller Transformation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Muller_transform) is used for generating random variable with normal distribution.

The release version has a Linux executable file called "Vanilla_Option_Pricing".
